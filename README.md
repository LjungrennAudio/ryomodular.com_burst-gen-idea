 a burst generator like it says on the tin!

this is a very much basic project ijn my world - i wanted a burst gen in the lineup so i designed one. it has all the useable and easy features t0  give such a thing simply by nature of it's design but i dint fidn it especially challenging ro satisfying to work on so it isnt especially dear to me - just another module that does what it's sped to very well and ably and wouldnt be at a lossin any system i can think of - jsut at home anywhere really...

tbh, yet again i'm seeing a candidate for cnnibalising intoa  larger, fancier module and never actually giving re;ease status as is.
